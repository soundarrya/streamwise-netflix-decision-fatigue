# Action Plan – How Netflix Can Actually Fix This

Based on what the data is telling us, here's what Netflix should do—broken into realistic phases.

---

## Phase 1 – Quick Wins (Next 2 Weeks)

These are changes Netflix could make *right now* that would immediately help:

| What to Do | Why It Works |
|---|---|
| **Make "Continue Watching" more prominent** | People already know they like these shows—put them at the top so users can jump right back in without scrolling |
| **Stop mixing totally different genres in the same row** | When a row shows comedies, thrillers, and documentaries together, it's confusing. Group similar content so people can scan faster |
| **Calm down with the "New Releases" spam** | When everything is labeled "NEW," nothing feels new. Show fewer, better-targeted new releases instead of overwhelming people |

**Why start here?** These don't require rebuilding algorithms—just smarter content placement. And they'd reduce scroll time almost immediately.

## Phase 2 – Medium-Term Improvements (Next 1-2 Months)

Once the quick wins are live, tackle these bigger changes:

| What to Do | Why It Works |
|---|---|
| **Customize the homepage by user personality** | Show "Curious Explorers" discovery tools and variety. Show "Comfort Rewatchers" their favorites immediately. Stop treating everyone the same. |
| **Recommend different content at different times of day** | Morning commute = short episodes. Tuesday night = comfort shows. Saturday afternoon = movies. Match recommendations to when and why people are watching. |
| **Replace endless carousels with "We think you'll love this"** | Instead of 50 options per row, highlight 1-2 shows per persona that are highly likely to match. Reduce choice paralysis. |

**Why this matters?** This moves from "better content placement" to "actually understanding the user's context and mood."

## Phase 3 – Long-Term Strategy (Next 3-6 Months)

These are the big architectural changes that require engineering investment:

| What to Do | Why It Works |
|---|---|
| **Build short-term session models** | Instead of recommending based on what you watched last year, recommend based on what you watched in the last 3 sessions. If you just binged true crime, show more true crime—not rom-coms. |
| **Stop showing genres users always skip** | If someone *never* clicks on anime or stand-up comedy, stop wasting recommendation space on those genres. Show more of what they actually engage with. |
| **Turn decision fatigue into a feedback signal** | Use scroll-to-watch ratio as a quality metric for the recommendation algorithm. High scroll + no watch = the algorithm failed. Train the system to minimize that. |

**Why this is strategic?** This fundamentally improves how Netflix's recommendation engine learns and adapts—making it smarter over time, not just better-arranged.

## How We'll Know It's Working

Success isn't abstract—it's measurable:

**Before improvements:**
- Average scroll time: 8 minutes
- Watch-start rate: 60%
- Decision fatigue score: 7.2

**After improvements:**
- **Average scroll time ↓** (target: under 3 minutes)
- **Watch-start rate ↑** (target: above 80%)
- **Decision fatigue score ↓** (target: under 4.0)

## Why This Action Plan Works

**It's realistic**
- Starts with easy changes, builds to complex ones
- Doesn't require Netflix to rebuild everything overnight

**It's prioritized**
- Quick wins first = immediate impact
- Strategic changes later = long-term transformation

**It's measurable**
- Every phase has clear success metrics
- Netflix can track progress and adjust

**It connects to revenue**
- Less decision fatigue = more watching
- More watching = happier users
- Happier users = lower churn = more subscription revenue

## My Role in This

I didn't just analyze data and walk away. I translated findings into a **roadmap that a product team could actually execute**.

This shows I understand:
- How to prioritize based on impact vs. effort
- How to speak the language of product managers and executives
- How to move from "here's a problem" to "here's exactly what to do about it"

**That's the difference between a data analyst and a business analyst.**
