# BA Case Study – Netflix Decision Fatigue

## 1) The Real-World Problem

We've all been there: you sit down to watch Netflix, spend 20 minutes scrolling through options, and then just... close the app and do something else.

**This isn't just annoying—it's costing Netflix money.**

Here's what's happening:
- Netflix has thousands of shows and movies (which should be great)
- But more choice = more overwhelm
- Users get mentally exhausted trying to decide
- They give up and leave without watching anything

This is called **decision fatigue**, and it's both a psychology problem and a data problem.

## 2) What's Actually Going Wrong

**The core issue:** Netflix's recommendation engine isn't reading the room.

Think about it this way:
- You come home tired on a Tuesday night
- You want something light and easy to watch
- Netflix shows you: intense documentaries, complex dramas, and shows you've never heard of
- You scroll... and scroll... trying to find something that fits your mood
- Eventually you just give up

**The symptoms:**
- **Scrolling is going UP** (users browsing longer before watching)
- **Watching is going DOWN** (fewer people actually clicking play)
- **Frustration is building** (users feel lost instead of excited)

## 3) Questions We Need to Answer

These aren't just data questions—they're about understanding human behavior:

| What I'm investigating | Why it actually matters |
|---|---|
| **Which recommendations cause the longest scroll time?** | Shows us where the algorithm is completely missing the mark—it's suggesting stuff people clearly don't want |
| **Which types of users struggle most to find content?** | Helps us understand if certain user groups (like casual viewers vs. binge-watchers) need different approaches |
| **Which genres get ignored most often?** | Tells us what content is being buried or mis-positioned |
| **Do people want different things at different times?** | Maybe Tuesday night needs different recommendations than Saturday afternoon |

## 4) Why Netflix Should Care (The Business Impact)

Let's be blunt about what this costs:

| What happens | What it means for Netflix |
|---|---|
| **People browse but don't watch** | Wasted platform time. They could be watching (= engagement) but instead they're frustrated (= churn risk) |
| **Users cancel subscriptions** | "I pay $15/month and can never find anything to watch" is a real reason people leave |
| **Netflix shows the wrong content** | Every recommendation slot wasted on irrelevant content is a missed opportunity to show something they'd actually love |
| **Competitors look better** | If Prime Video or Disney+ feel "easier," users will shift their time there |

**Bottom line:** If people can't choose what to watch quickly, they stop coming back.

## 5) Why We Need This Analysis

Netflix isn't just competing with other streaming services—**they're competing with everything else you could do with your time.**

If choosing what to watch feels like work, users will:
- Check Instagram instead
- Play a video game instead  
- Just go to bed instead

**What this project does:**
- Uses SQL to measure exactly where and why decision fatigue happens
- Finds patterns in when recommendations fail
- Identifies which users are most at risk of leaving
- Gives Netflix specific, data-backed actions to fix it

This isn't about writing fancy queries—it's about using data to solve a frustrating user experience problem.

## 6) What "Fixed" Looks Like

How do we know if this works? Clear, measurable outcomes:

  - **Users scroll less** before finding something to watch  
  - **More people click "play"** instead of giving up  
  - **Recommendations feel personalized** (right mood, right time, right person)  
  - **Users feel excited, not exhausted** when they open the app

**Success = Netflix stops being the app people get tired using.**

## My Role in Solving This

I'm not just analyzing data—I'm connecting user frustration to business impact, then building the SQL infrastructure to measure and fix it.

This case study shows I understand:
- The psychology behind user behavior
- How to translate "I can't find anything to watch" into measurable metrics
- How to build analytics that answer "what should we do about this?"
- How data work connects to revenue, retention, and real people's experiences
