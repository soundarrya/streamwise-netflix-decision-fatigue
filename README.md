## The Problem 

You know that feeling when you spend 20 minutes scrolling through Netflix and then just... give up and close the app? That's not just you—it's a massive problem for Netflix.

**Here's what happens:**
- Users open Netflix excited to watch something
- They scroll... and scroll... and scroll
- Decision fatigue kicks in
- They close the app without watching anything

**Why Netflix cares:**
- Lower engagement = unhappy users
- Unhappy users = people canceling subscriptions
- Lost revenue and platform trust

This project digs into the data behind this frustrating user experience.

## What I Actually Built

Instead of just theorizing about the problem, I built a real analytics system to measure it:

**1. Data Foundation**
- Created a proper database structure (dimension + fact tables) to track viewing sessions
- Modeled how users actually behave: browsing, scrolling, clicking, watching (or giving up)

**2. Realistic Test Data**
- Generated 100+ viewing sessions that mirror real user behavior
- Different user types, different times of day, different outcomes

**3. Analytics That Answer Real Questions**
- How long are people scrolling before they watch something (or quit)?
- Which recommendations actually work?
- What patterns exist in users who successfully find content vs. those who give up?
- Who's most at risk of decision fatigue?

**4. Business Recommendations**
- Turned the numbers into actual actions Netflix could take
- Identified which user groups need the most help
- Suggested concrete UX improvements based on the data

## Why This Project Matters

Here's the thing: **anyone can write SQL queries.**

What separates a SQL developer from a business-focused analyst is this:
- I didn't just build tables and write queries
- I asked: "Why are users frustrated?" and "What should we do about it?"
- I connected technical work to a real business problem that costs Netflix millions

**This project shows I can:**
- Design data models that reflect real-world behavior
- Write SQL that answers business questions (not just technical ones)
- Think like both an analyst AND a stakeholder
- Turn data into decisions

Documentation

Full technical writeup, SQL scripts, and business case study available in the `/docs` folder.
## Bottom Line

This isn't just a portfolio project—it's a demonstration of how data work should connect to business impact.

I used SQL to understand **why users close Netflix**, and more importantly, **what could fix it**.
